# 3D Card Examples

This is cool example of how to implement a 3D card with two sides: a front side and a back side. The card will flip over when you hover, or stay flipped over if you select it. It leverages default CSS and tailwind for the effect.

This project contains two examples: a "cool" example (Because yugioh cards are simply cooler than boring subscript tier cards - don't ask) and a "practical" example.

If you click on a YuGiOh card, a modal will appear that displays stats on the card. This was implemented with a little magic from framer-motion and V0

## Installation

To run and install the project, simply use the following two commands:

```
npm i
npm run dev

```
